A chemical reason
If reason's your game
A chemical needing
Is there in the brain
With preprogrammed meanings
Like a little more pep
Alien feelings
We have to accept

When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
